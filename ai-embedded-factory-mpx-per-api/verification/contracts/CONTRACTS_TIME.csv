sleep;REQ-API-0180;User Manual;0 Successful sleep – no remaining seconds. | positive number Sleep was interrupted by a signal sent to this | thread. This value represents the number of seconds left to sleep. | Real-time Scenarios: | Upon the successful execution of this service, the following real-time scenarios are possible: | SUSPENSION. The calling thread is suspended until the specified time has lapsed or another thread sends a signal to this thread. | Stack Usage Estimate: | From the location where this API is called, at least (132 + MPX_BINDING_STACK_FRAME_SIZE) bytes of stack should be available.
